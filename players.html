              </h4>
              <p class="bio">
                GM Magnus Carlsen is the current world chess champion. To many
                people, he’s the best to ever play the game, although GMs Garry
                Kasparov and Bobby Fischer remain in the conversation. At any
                rate, the clear and remarkable point is that before turning 30
                years old, Carlsen has already earned a spot at the top.
                <br /><br />It’s easy to see why. The 13-year-old Norwegian
                prodigy drew Kasparov and defeated GM Anatoly Karpov at the same
                event in 2004, one month before he became the second-youngest GM
                in history (and still eighth-youngest as of 2021). In 2009, he
                became the youngest player to break the 2800-rating threshold (a
                record only broken by GM Alireza Firouzja in 2021).<br /><br />
                Then Carlsen transitioned from young world-class player to
                all-time great. He captured the world number-one ranking in 2011
                and still hasn’t let go of it. He won the world title in 2013
                and has successfully defended it four times (2014, 2016, 2018,
                and 2021). Additionally, he has won multiple world titles in
                rapid (twice) and blitz (four times) time controls, achieved the
                highest rating ever, and racked up several elite tournament
                wins, including four Norway Chess victories and seven in Wijk
                aan Zee.<br /><br />The amazing part is it seems like there’s
                much more ahead for Carlsen. In October 2020 Carlsen's 125-game
                undefeated streak came to an end (he scored 42 wins and 83 draws
                during this streak), setting yet another world record. If he
                continues performing the way he has, Carlsen could create
                something truly legendary. In an era of chess that’s more
                competitive than ever, he’s far ahead of the opposition.
